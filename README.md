	-Fixed the reroll function so that it won't fail if you type "y", though an or statement for "y" or "Y" doesn't want to work.
	-Added the option to manually select a class to randomize a loadout for or to pick a random class.
Version 1.01
	-Added a for loop to run the program a specific number of times specified by the user.
	-Added empty print statements to act as line breaks, which will format the repeated for loop much more nicely.
