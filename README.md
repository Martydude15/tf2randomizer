Team Fortress 2 Class and Loadout Randomizer

What this program does: picks a random class and randomly chooses the loadout from arrays containing strings of the names of each class' primary, secondary, and melee weapons. You can also manually pick a class or a random class as of version 1.2. I'm kind of a novice programmer, so please pardon the mess in the source code if you want to look at it. This is coded in Python and converted into an EXE with Py2exe, though there is a C++ port, but I found working with Python for this to be much easier.
